This project was inspired by John Purcell's Java for Complete Beginners course. 

The calculator uses the Harris-Benedict equation for basal metabolic rate and multiples the BMR by the activity level of the user.

Feel free to use it in any way you wish (college assignments, teaching, etc). Attribution would be nice as a matter of courtesy, however, it is not necessary.

I have tested it, though not thoroughly, so it may have errors. Feel free to make improvements. Make a note of the amendments you made especially if you need to submit evidence of work.

While the code is largely based on using imperial units and calculates metric units automatically, you may wish to develop it to use metric units and convert to imperial if you use the metric system.

To quote John Purcell, "Happy coding!"
